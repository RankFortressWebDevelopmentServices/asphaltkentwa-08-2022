                    1. Asphalt is durable and can last for many years
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asphalt is a type of pavement that is made from bitumen, which is a sticky, black, and viscous substance. Asphalt is durable and can last for many years, making it a popular choice for roads and parking lots. In addition to its durability, asphalt is also easy to <a href="https://asphaltkentwa.com/asphalt-repair/">repair</a> if it becomes damaged. Asphalt can be recycled and reused, making it a sustainable option for paving surfaces. While asphalt is more expensive than gravel, it requires less maintenance over time and can provide a smoother driving surface. For these reasons, asphalt is an ideal choice for both residential and commercial paving projects.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asphalt is a type of pavement that is commonly used on roads and driveways. It is made from a mixture of aggregate, binder, and filler materials. Asphalt is unique among pavement materials in that it is flexible, rather than rigid. This flexibility makes asphalt resistant to cracking under the weight of traffic and changes in temperature. Asphalt pavements are also able to withstand minor settlements and movements without <a href="https://asphaltkentwa.com/crack-sealing/">cracking</a>. In addition, asphalt pavements can be easily repaired if they do develop cracks. As a result, asphalt is an ideal material for high-traffic areas such as roads and parking lots.
